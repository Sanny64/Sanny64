Hi, I'm Sanny
A dual student in computer sciences from Germany.  

Atm I'm working with:
1. JavaScript (ServiceNow, Discord, Web)
2. HTML, CSS
3. Python
4. Java (only for University)

In my free time, I`m a discord server developer and admin, gamer and event host for friends. 

I hope we come along greatly!
