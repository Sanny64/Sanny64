Hi, I'm Sanny
A 21y/o dual B.Sc Computer Science student from Germany.  

I mainly focuse on agile project management but I also love to code.

I am currently working for the Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH and we are creating an intern ServiceNow-service in an international Scrum Team.
  - JavaScript Software Engineering and ServiceNow DevOps
I have also worked for the Deutsche Telekom Technik GmbH as a Data Scientist and FullStack Python developer.
  - Data Scientist and Fullstack Python Developer

The public projects I have been working on are:
1. PROSCRUM - Golf-Handicap-Calculator: https://github.com/Sanny64/PROSCRUM hosted at [Golf-Handicap-Calculator](http://164.30.73.144/login) - Scrum Master and PL in a scrum student environment (6 contributors)
2. SAU - Student Assistant Utility: https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25 hosted at [SAU Portal](https://sau-portal.de/) - Product Owner in a scaled scrum student environment (120 contributors)

My first ever website is this one:
https://github.com/Sanny64/TelekomProvadis - I made this during my first semester of studying computer science with 2 friends.

In my free time I like to play games, bake and organize events for my friends :)

I hope we come along greatly and happy coding!
